### *What is the difference between a MAC and IP address?*

MAC is associated with a NIC (network interface card) and is a hardware address. IP is used for **routing** data packets in a network and is a logical address.

### *What is the difference between Routing and Forwarding?*

Routing is the process of moving data from one device to another device and Works on protocols like Routing Information Protocol (RIP) for Routing.. Forwarding is simply defined as the action applied by each router when a packet arrives at one of its interfaces and Works on protocols like UDP Encapsulating Security Payloads.  

### *How are IP addresses assigned?*

IP addresses can be assigned static (manual) or using a dynamic assignment like Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

### *What is a private IP address?*

Private IP addresses are IP addresses reserved for use within private networks and are not directly accessible from the internet. They are used to allow devices within a private network to communicate with each other. Some common private IP address ranges include 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, and 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.
