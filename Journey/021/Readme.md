# *Understand infrastructure as code (IaC) concepts*

## *What is IaC:grey_question:*

Imagine you're building a house. Traditionally, you would need to manually lay each brick, one by one, until the house is complete. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale if you want to build multiple houses.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a similar concept, but instead of building houses, we're building IT infrastructure. With IaC, we treat infrastructure components like virtual machines, networks, and storage as code, just like you would write code for a software application. This means we can define the desired state of our infrastructure in a file, and then use tools to automatically create and manage that infrastructure.

- Step 1: Write a configuration file that describes the desired state of your infrastructure, including the number of servers, their hardware specifications, and the software they should run.

- Step 2: Use an IaC tool to read the configuration file and automatically provision the infrastructure according to the specifications.

- Step 3: The IaC tool will create the necessary servers, install the required software, and configure the network settings.

### *Advantages of IaC patterns*

- **Enhanced Consistency and Repeatability**

- **Accelerated Provisioning and Deployment**

- **Improved Collaboration and Version Control**

- **Reduced Operational Costs**

- **Enhanced Compliance and Security**

- **Increased Agility and Adaptability**

- **Improved Documentation and Auditability**

- **Enhanced Self-Service Capabilities**

- **Facilitated Multi-Cloud Adoption**

- **Promotes Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**
