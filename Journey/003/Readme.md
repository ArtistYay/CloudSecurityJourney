# MAC Addresses

A Media Access Control (MAC) address, also known as a hardware address or physical address, is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

- MAC addresses are unique. Every NIC has a unique MAC address assigned to it by the manufacturer, ensuring that no two devices on a network have the same MAC address. This uniqueness is crucial for preventing network conflicts and ensuring proper communication between devices.

- MAC addresses are permanent. Unlike IP addresses, which can be dynamically assigned or changed, MAC addresses are permanently etched into the hardware of the NIC. This permanence provides a reliable and consistent way to identify devices on a network.

- MAC addresses are used for local network communication. MAC addresses are primarily used for addressing devices within a local network segment. They play a vital role in the data link layer of the OSI model, enabling devices to communicate with each other directly without the need for routing.

- MAC addresses can be used for security purposes. MAC address filtering, a security measure that restricts access to a network based on MAC addresses, can be used to enhance network security and prevent unauthorized access.

- MAC addresses can be spoofed. While MAC addresses are generally considered permanent and unique, it is possible for hackers to spoof or change their MAC addresses to disguise their identity and gain unauthorized access to a network.
